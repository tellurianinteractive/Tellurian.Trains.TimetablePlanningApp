# Timetable Planning App
**Yet another experimental web application for working with scheduling of model railway operation at module meetings.**
This project will not be further developed.

This application tries out some improvements and new features based on the experiences with [the timetable prototype application](https://github.com/fjallemark/TimetablePlanningApp).
Features from this app and from the prototype application will eventually finds its way into the Timetable App that will be open sourced.

## Graphical Schedule Component
This conponent can present graphical timetables with time axis horisontally or vertically just by a configuration setting.
It can optionally presents arrival and departure minutes, also by configiration settings.

## Validation of XPLN documents
It is now possible to validate XPLN-plans online. 
It's a first stage to import XPLN into the database.
Import of XPLN-files will be a good source for easily getting a lot of test data into the database.
Using the test data from XPLN-files, 
the reports to print documentation can be tested.

## Improven Note Format
Automatic (and manual) notes is more CSS-format friendly, which can improve readability and customizations.
